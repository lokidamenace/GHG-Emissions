# Future Footprints: Predicting Trends in Greenhouse Gas Emissions
![ppt title page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fb4b6b5-5e25-44a2-9dd6-282ea94a4a6a)

Climate change is a pressing crisis that we face today, primarily driven by human emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. I want to explore this issue further to identify the factors contributing to these increased emissions and predict how these rates may change in the coming years. To effectively reduce emissions, it is crucial to determine their sources. The goal is to identify the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and to forecast future emission levels.

### Tasks to Complete
o	Unsupervised learning: Explore and analyze greenhouse gas emissions data to reveal hidden patterns or insights without predefined labels. </br>
o	Data visualization: Visualize emission trends across different countries.

### Data Analysis Overview
o	Identify groups (clusters) of countries with similar emission profiles, economic activities, or sustainability practices. </br>
o	Simplify complex multi-dimensional emission data into interpretable visual forms (PCA). </br>
o	Identify countries or sectors with unusual emission profiles. </br>
o	Building a prediction model with accuracy.
