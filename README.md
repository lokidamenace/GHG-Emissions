# Future Footprints: Predicting Trends in Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Climate change is a pressing crisis that we face today, primarily driven by human emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. I want to explore this issue further to identify the factors contributing to these increased emissions and predict how these rates may change in the coming years. To effectively reduce emissions, it is crucial to determine their sources. The goal is to identify the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and to forecast future emission levels.
