Climate change is a pressing and fundamental crisis, primarily driven by human emissions of CO₂ and other greenhouse gases. In this practicum project, I aim to dig deeper into this issue by explicitly identifying the key factors contributing to increased emissions and forecasting how emission rates are likely to evolve in the coming years. Additionally, since effectively reducing emissions requires an understanding of their sources, this project will focus on determining the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and predicting future emission trends.

### Background
Greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), water vapor, and synthetic fluorinated gases, play a critical role in Earth's climate system. These gases naturally trap some of the sun's heat, helping to maintain a stable climate that is suitable for life. However, human activities have significantly increased their concentrations in the atmosphere. 

For instance, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Monitoring Laboratory reported that atmospheric CO₂ levels reached approximately 430 parts per million (ppm) in early 2025, a significant rise from pre-industrial levels of around 280 ppm. Similarly, methane concentrations have increased dramatically, with current atmospheric levels above 1,900 parts per billion (ppb), more than double the pre-industrial levels.

These increased greenhouse gas concentrations amplify the natural greenhouse effect, resulting in global warming and significant shifts in climate patterns. The consequences include extreme weather events, rising sea levels, disruptions to ecosystems, and adverse health effects. Addressing the increase in greenhouse gases is crucial for environmental sustainability, human health, economic stability, and the future resilience of global communities.

### Project Overview
This practicum project will apply unsupervised learning techniques to explore and analyze greenhouse gas emissions data, aiming to reveal hidden patterns and insights without predefined labels. Furthermore, the analysis will utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify complex, multi-dimensional emissions data into easily interpretable visual forms. Additionally, the project aims to identify countries or sectors that exhibit unusual emission patterns. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a reliable and accurate prediction model to forecast future trends in greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the project will clearly illustrate emission trends across various countries through data visualization, highlighting distinct clusters of countries sharing similar emission profiles, economic activities, or sustainability practices. 

### Project Timeline
The project timeline is divided into eight weekly phases, providing a clear roadmap from initial setup to final presentation.
